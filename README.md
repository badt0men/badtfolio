# Daniel Dozie Dev

This project started as a fun implementation of libraries and testing out the best options. But then, I found out that, there's no one size fits all approach to this other than doing what makes you comforatable. Whatever gives you better workflow should always be what you use. Nonetheless, trying out other fun approach should not skip your mind.

Do well to leave me feedbacks and comments via the contact form.

I really do hope I find time to switch to writing articles. But, you can entertain yourself with a few articles from [Simon Griggs]('https://www.simeongriggs.dev/') I reposted because I found them very insightful and direct.
